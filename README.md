# Adding Flow to a React app example

This example contains two directories, one showing a React app that does not use Flow type checking, and the second the same app with the addition of Flow types.

It is made to go along with this [blog post](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/incrementally-add-flow-type-checking-react-261fee015f80).
